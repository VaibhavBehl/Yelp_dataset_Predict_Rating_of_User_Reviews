# Yelp_dataset_rating_classification_of_reviews

Did this project during the fall of 2015 while taking a class in Applied Natural Language Processing(CSCI-544). 
This was a group project and I worked with Yao Fan, Farhan Khwaja and Arjun Pola.   

The goal of this project was to classify user reviews on a scale of 1 to 5 using only the 'text' from the review.
Applied various multiclass classification algorithms and dealt with nuisances like skewed data. 
Also discovered that F-score is not such a good measure of performance of an algorithm where classes 
are almost identical(like difference between a 2-3 star review and 3-4 star review). Thus used MAE/MSE as 
metric while tuning for hyper-parameters and comparing the final results. 
See the 'Individual_Project_Report.pdf' for more details.
